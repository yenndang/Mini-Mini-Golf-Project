# Save the stranded forest fairy
A fairy is stranded in a magical forest! She ran out of pixie dust and can't safely make her way back home. It's up to you to bring her a shipment of pixie dust. You must navigate the magical forest to reach her, but beware: Although the forest is a very special place, home to bright flowers, rolling hills, and shiny rocks, it also has some tricky spots! You'll need to get past twisty tree roots, roll through a fairy's house, and pop down some magic mushrooms. Each hit of the ball gets you closer to the fairy's home. When you finally get the ball in the right spot, the wood fairy will dance and be free to fly away, thanks to you!
